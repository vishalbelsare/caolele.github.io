    Mobile gaming has become increasingly popular due to the growing usage of smartphones in day to day life. In recent years, this advancement has led to an interest in the application of in-game recommendation systems. However, the in-game recommendation is more challenging than common recommendation scenarios, such as e-commerce, for a number of reasons: (1) the player behavior and context change at a fast pace, (2) only a few items (few-shot) can be exposed, and (3) with an existing hand-crafted heuristic recommendation, performing randomized explorations to collect data is not a business choice that is preferred by game stakeholders. To that end, we propose an end-to-end model called DFSNet (Debiasing Few-Shot Network) that enables training an in-game recommender on an imbalanced dataset that is biased by the existing heuristic policy. We experimentally evaluate the performance of DFSNet both in an offline setup on a validation dataset and online in a real-time serving environment, illustrating the correctness and effectiveness of the trained model.
